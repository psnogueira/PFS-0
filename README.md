# Pong from scratch

This is a clone of the classic game Pong implemented in C++ using the Windows API for window management and OpenGL for rendering.

## Overview

This project aims to recreate the game Pong using fundamental graphics concepts with OpenGL and Windows API. It emphasizes loading OpenGL functions directly from the driver without relying on an external library like GLEW or GLAD.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.
- **Windows OS**: The project is designed using Windows API and will NOT work on other operating systems.
- **OpenGL Drivers**: Ensure that your system supports OpenGL and has compatible drivers installed.

## Usage

- Compile and run the application.
- Use the keyboard arrow keys or designated keys (defined in the game) to control the paddles.
- The game ends when one player reaches the winning score (predefined or configurable).
- Enjoy playing Pong!
